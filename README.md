# todo_app

A ToDo Flutter project.

## Getting Started

A to-do Flutter app built using clean architecture and the BLoC pattern follows a structured and modular approach to software development. Clean architecture enforces separation of concerns by dividing the application into different layers, each having a specific responsibility. The BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern is a reactive programming paradigm that separates the presentation layer from the business logic.

The application can be divided into three layers: the presentation layer, the domain layer, and the data layer. The presentation layer contains the UI code and is responsible for rendering the views and handling user interactions. The domain layer contains the business logic and defines the use cases of the application. The data layer is responsible for fetching and storing data from and to external sources.
